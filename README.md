### Test Task 2: Workflow logs checker application
 [test task 1](https://github.com/alexarlord-boop/jb-intern/blob/main/task1.md)

### Description
Develop a client-server application that displays a Git repository's log, retrieved on the server, in a web browser. If required, make use of assumptions to simplify the problem. Any framework and language can be used for the task, but staying in the JVM stack is preferable.

### Assumptions
* GitHub REST API as a source
* Only public repos assessed
* Workflow runs (github actions) as a log content
* User makes authorised requests to the API
* We have user authN, authZ implemented and have access to github api token for authorized request.

### Solution
