# Improving Kotlin Continuous Integration

**Goal:** enhance the reliability and productivity of the Kotlin Infrastructure team's CI process.

**Task:** create an addition to the CI that organizes incoming pushes into a queue, allowing them to proceed only if all quality gates pass.

**Challenge:** make this queue suitable for a large team and compatible with multiple connected repositories.

# Solution Approach
### Understanding the Current CI Workflow
I would familiarize myself with the existing CI setup to understand the current workflow, including how pushes trigger builds, the existing quality gates, and the overall architecture, including official documentation.

### Define Scope
During initial discussion and further collaboration with the team I would investigate and define specific requirements for the CI queue, taking into consideration the needs of a large team, define boundaries and limits of the preferred solution to narrow down the focus.

### Research on Existing Solutions, used Tech Stack
Explore existing CI/CD tools and systems that the team is willing to have in solution, identify potential substitute solutions or components that can be integrated into the Kotlin CI.

# Design and Architecture
### Queue Design
Propose a queue design that efficiently handles a large number of pushes without waiting for each run. Consider asynchronous processing, parallelism, and scalability.

### Integration with Quality Gates
Design the integration of the queue with existing quality gates, ensuring that a push can proceed only if all the required checks and tests pass.

### Handling Multiple Repositories
Develop a strategy for managing pushes across multiple connected repositories. Consider synchronization, dependency management, and ensuring consistency in the CI process.
Implementation

# Implementation
Here are some of generic ideas related to the implementation process that I usually follow.
### Prototyping
I would definitely begin with a small-scale prototype to validate the queue design. Also, diagrams, schemes are very helpful in understanding a bigger picture and components interactions.


### Incremental Development
Adopt an incremental approach to implement queue functionality, starting with basic features and gradually adding complexity. Iterate and adjust based on team feedback for an effective development process.
